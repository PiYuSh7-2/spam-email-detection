Spam Email Detection Model


This project contains a machine learning model for classifying emails as spam or not spam. The model uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the content of emails and determine if they are spam.

Features


Text Preprocessing: Cleans and tokenizes the email text to remove unnecessary elements like stopwords and special characters.

Modeling: Trains using machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest to classify emails.

Evaluation: Assesses model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Technologies Used


Python: Main programming language.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.

Pandas: For data manipulation and processing.

NLTK/Spacy: For text preprocessing and tokenization.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing results.
